In a way, it\u2019s hardly surprising that cost savings and vendor lock-in are two main factors that drive the adoption of open-source database software, according to a 2020 study by Percona.</p><p>This blog post will explore the meaning and implications of vendor lock-in when adopting database software.</p><h2 id="what-is-vendor-lock-in" tabindex="-1">What is vendor lock-in? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-vendor-lock-in" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>According to Wikipedia, \u201Cvendor lock-in, also known as proprietary lock-in or customer lock-in, makes a customer dependent on a vendor for products, unable to use another vendor without substantial switching costs.\u201D</p><p>Vendor lock-in makes you dependent on a single vendor or technology without an easy way to migrate or switch to new software in the future without incurring significant financial implications, legal constraints, integration, or compatibility issues.</p><p>In its place, companies can enjoy all the benefits that their license covers, including maintenance, regular updates, hosting options, etc.</p>',8);function l(d,p,h,u,f,w){const e=t("Footer");return a(),n("div",null,[c,r(e)])}const _=o(i,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,_ as default};
